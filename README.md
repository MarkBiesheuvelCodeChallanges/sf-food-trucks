# San Francisco Food Trucks

A service that tells the user what types of food trucks might be found near a specific location on a map.

## Importer

This project uses a data set that is made available by the [City and County of San Francisco](https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat).
This data is imported into a DynamoDB database with the following commands

In order to be able to execute these commands you need to have a valid AWS access key and secret configured on your machine.
The user associated with these credentials also needs permissions to perform these actions.

To download the data file
```bash
wget https://data.sfgov.org/resource/6a9r-agq8.json -O import/food_trucks.json
```

To create DynamoDB table. (One time only)
```bash
node import/create-table.js
```

To import the complete dataset
```bash
node import/import.js
```

## API

The API is available at [https://09ajp1m1wc.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/prod/FoodTruck](https://09ajp1m1wc.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/prod/FoodTruck)

### Usage

The API endpoint accepts `POST` request with a raw json body.

This json object is required to have a `bound` object with `north`, `east`, `south`, and `west` floats.
The API will return all food trucks within an area equal to or larger than given by these bounds.

It is possible to filter the food trucks based on name by setting a `name` string.

It is possible to filter the food trucks based on which day they are open setting an `open_on` string.

### Example (jQuery)
```javascript
var request = {
  "bounds": { /* required */
      "north": 37.77914004014629, /* required */
      "east": -122.40716912689209, /* required */
      "south": 37.77065971667162, /* required */
      "west": -122.4316308731079 /* required */
  },
  "name": "Natan's", /* optional */
  "open_on": "tu" /* optional */
};

$.ajax({
    url: 'https://09ajp1m1wc.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/prod/FoodTruck',
    method: 'POST',
    data: JSON.stringify(request),
    contentType: 'application/json; charset=utf-8',
    dataType: 'json',
    success: function (response) {
        if ('errorMessage' in response) {
            console.error(response.errorMessage);
        } else {
            response.forEach(function (item) {
                /* Do something with item */
            });
        }
    }
});
```

## Code challenge

The following paragraphs are about the code challenge for which I created this project.

### Track

The focus during this code challenge was on the back-end.

My familiarity with the technical stack is:
- **jQuery**: A lot of experience
- **Google Maps JavaScript API**: A lot of experience
- **Node.js** / **AWS Lambda**: A bit of experience
- **NoSQL databases** /  **DynamoDB**: No experience

### Technical choices, including architectural

My goal for this code challenge is to try out and develop a serverless architecture.

To accomplish this I have chosen to use the following set of microservices:
* [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb): Store locations based on their coordinates to perform quick queries
* [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) &Â [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/): Provide API to retrieve data
* [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) Host static front-end (HTML/JavaScript)

In hindsight however I am not sure using DynamoDB was the right choice.
Looking back I should have spend more time researching what is possible with this NoSQL database compared to others.

One of the difficulties I tried to solve was loading the markers within specific bounds.
I wanted to avoid sending the whole data set when a user first loaded the map.
I made up a formula that maps a set of coordinates to buckets.
It does this by rounding the latitude and longitude to one hundredths of a degree.
These buckets correspond to the hash key of the DynamoDB database.

```javascript
var latlng = Math.floor(latitude * 100) + ',' + Math.floor(longitude * 100);
```

Another challenge was to extract useful information from the data set.
For example on which day a food truck is open.
In the data set this is a human-readable string such as `Mo-Fr`, `Mo/We/Fr`, or `We/Fr-Su`.
To check whether a food truck is open a given day I match this string against the following regexes:

```javascript
var dayRegexes = {
    'mo': /mo/i,
    'tu': /(tu|mo-)/i,
    'we': /(we|(mo|tu)-(th|fr|sa|su))/i,
    'th': /(tu|(mo|tu|we)-(fr|sa|su))/i,
    'fr': /(fr|(mo|tu|we|th)-(sa|su))/i,
    'sa': /(sa|-su)/i,
    'su': /su/i
};
```

### Further improvements

- Reconsider database engine
- Add more filters
- Preload markers when dragging the map
- Use `batchWrite` when importing data (if still using DynamoDB)
- Minimize assets (HTML/JavaScript/CSS)
- Custom builds of jQuery/Bootstrap
